    "**Objective:** In this lab, you will learn how to build Binary Logistic Regression model to predict `heart failure` patients. Not only that, you will learn to detect informative features for maximizing the potential of the constructed models. You will also see that **quantitative features** are not always the most important ones in building a good predictive model. You have to treat all types of data carefully.\n",
