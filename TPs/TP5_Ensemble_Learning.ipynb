This dataset contains information such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, and body mass index (BMI). The goal is to use this data to build predictive models that can help identify individuals at high risk of stroke, enabling early intervention and potentially saving lives. It is a very highly imbalanced dataset, you may face challenges in building a model. Random sampling and weighting methods may be considered.
